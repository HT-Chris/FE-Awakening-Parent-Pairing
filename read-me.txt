This is an app that will help you plan out which pairings of parents you want for the game Fire Emblem Awakening.

In this app you'll pair up parent units that will show  both unit's classes and skills, along with their child if available.If the parent units have a child then the app will display skills that the child can not learn but can be passed down by one of their parents.

You can save pairings to a list and the app will automatically grey out paired units.

You can remove a pairing from the list to have the units available to be paired with another unit.

A pairing can be redisplay.

Hope you have fun with this app!
